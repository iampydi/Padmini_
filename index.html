        <strong>Good Touch:</strong> Good touch refers to physical contact that is safe, comforting, and respectful. Examples of good touch include a warm hug from a loved one, a handshake, or a pat on the back as a sign of encouragement or support.
        Good touch is consensual and does not cause discomfort, pain, or harm.
        In the simplest words, good touch is when an individual is comfortable. And feels protected. Teach your child about gestures full of warmth like a gentle hug, a pat on the back, a kiss on the forehead, or a handshake, etc. He/she can consider all these as a good as long as it does not feel uncomfortable or forceful. Similarly, bad touch is right the opposite.

        <strong>Bad Touch:</strong> Bad touch refers to physical contact that is inappropriate, uncomfortable, and violates personal boundaries. Examples of bad touch include unwanted touching of private body parts, forced kisses, groping, or any other form of non-consensual contact that causes distress or harm.
        Bad touch is unacceptable, and it is important to report it to a trusted adult or authority figure.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is crucial to teach children about good touch and bad touch, empowering them to recognize and speak up if they experience any form of inappropriate contact.
        By fostering open communication and providing a safe environment, we can protect children and ensure their physical and emotional well-being.
        A bad touch is the one that causes discomfort or uneasiness. So even if a simple caress, hug, cheek pulling, or pat is not likeable for the child, it can still be considered a bad touch. The repercussions of an undesirable touch can be sinister for a child. So make sure you elaborate on this one in more detail. And help the child to understand the difference between the two clearly. The best way to create an understanding of this touch is to tell the child about the body parts that are considered ‘private’. A simple explanation of these areas can help children understand how their body is completely theirs. And no one must touch the private areas, as this would mean a risk to their safety.

                 Tell your kids about various kinds of touches. For example, good touch feels caring, like a pat on the head, back, or a bear hug. In comparison, a bad touch can hurt your body or feelings, such as pinching, hitting, or touching any private area. Let children know that it’s ok to say no if you don’t like any touch, even from a friend or a family member.

      Parents sometimes use nicknames for sexual terms, which is inappropriate. Employing the appropriate terms for the body parts, such as the vagina, penis, and so on, makes these parts feel important. The right words will also be helpful for your child to express themselves accurately concerning their body.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your child should not feel guilty if they refuse affection from anyone for any reason. Educate your daughter that her feelings and decisions are paramount when it comes to her own physical space. This will help her to trust her emotions with clarity.

          And many parents delay talking to their kids about inappropriate touching, according to the C.S. Mott Children's Hospital National Poll on Children's Health at Michigan Medicine.

       "If you teach children the proper names and tell them these are the doctor words for these parts, it will strengthen their ability to communicate about these topics," Dickson says. "In turn, it will create more openness and less"You don't want to do anything that may make them feel embarrassed about asking questions. If you're uncomfortable talking about body parts, they will have discomfort as well."
       Parents may avoid the topic because they think that their children are too young and the subject might be scary. But there are ways to bring it up in normal conversation. Maybe it's at bath time, on the way to a doctor check up or before swim lessons.

        <h3><li><a href>At what age should we develop the awareness on good touch and bad touch</a></li></h3>
        <p>
        According to a leading media house, a child can be sensitized to this knowledge when he/she is 2 to 3 years old. At this age, kids start socializing outside their homes. Because they enter the preschools. And are exposed to many outsiders on a daily basis.
        </p>
        Kids speak to their parents confidently only when they feel a strong bonding within the family. As parents, we must ensure that our kids are heard each and every time when they come up to us. In fact, establishing family rules like having dinner together, etc. can help children to open up about their issues easily.
